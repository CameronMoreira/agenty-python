# Task: Implementing a 3D Chess Game in Python

## **Overview**

You are tasked with the design and implementation of a **3D chess game** as a **command-line Python application**. This task involves defining the structure, mechanics, and novel elements of a three-dimensional variant of traditional chess, and building a playable, documented software solution from scratch.

This challenge is deliberately **open-ended**. You will need to make critical design decisions regarding:

* How 3D chess should work (rules, dimensions, movement).
* What new mechanics and constraints the third dimension introduces.
* How players will interact with the game via the command line.

The game must include **at least two new custom-designed chess pieces**, with original movement rules that are well justified within your game system.

---

## **Core Requirements**

### **Game Design**

* Define a clear rule set for your version of 3D chess.
* Establish the game board's dimensional structure.
* Invent and integrate **two or more new chess pieces**, with unique and sensible rules.
* Address gameplay features such as:

    * Turn structure
    * Win conditions (check, checkmate, or adapted criteria)
    * Special moves (e.g., 3D castling equivalents)

### **Software Implementation**

* Build a playable command-line Python application.
* Use object-oriented or modular design to allow maintainability and clarity.
* Ensure players can:

    * View the current board state
    * Input moves
    * Receive feedback on legal/illegal moves
    * Play full games without manual intervention
    * Play against a basic AI or another player

## **Evaluation Criteria**

The project will be assessed on the following dimensions:

| Criterion             | Description                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Playability**       | The game must be fully playable from start to finish in the command line.                       |
| **Rule Coherence**    | Your chosen 3D chess rules should be internally consistent, clear, and justified.               |
| **Code Quality**      | Code must be readable, modular, and well-structured.                                            |
| **Documentation**     | Provide clear documentation of your rule set, codebase structure, and instructions for playing. |
| **Design Innovation** | Creativity in adapting chess mechanics to 3D and inventing new pieces is strongly encouraged.   |
