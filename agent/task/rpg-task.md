# Task: Build a Text-Based RPG in Python

Your objective is to design and implement a complete text-based role-playing game (RPG) in Python.

This is a creative and open-ended task. You will need to make design choices, write code, possibly create new tools or
utilities, and iterate on what you've built.

## Requirements (high-level, not exhaustive):

* Gameplay Systems:
    * A battle system with meaningful mechanics (e.g., turn-based, stats, skills).
    * At least two additional interlocking system, such as:
      * Character equipment and inventory
      * Skill trees or leveling 
      * Party dynamics or relationships
* Narrative:
  * A well-written story with a clear beginning and end.
  * Optional but encouraged: side quests, branching narratives, or reactive world elements.
* Worldbuilding:
  * A coherent world (fantasy, sci-fi, or other) with internal consistency and lore.
  * Creativity is encouragedâ€”this world should feel alive and interesting.

* Modularity & Reusability:
    * The codebase should be modular, maintainable, and documented.
    * Implementations should be clear enough for others (including agents) to extend or modify.
    * Design-choices and worldbuilding should be documented to allow for easy understanding and potential expansion.

## Constraints & Considerations:
* You may create new tools (e.g., a quest scripting language or battle simulator).
* You may use external libraries if justified and documented.
* You should coordinate and plan before and during implementation.
* The goal is not just to complete the task, but to showcase emergent problem solving, effective role assignment, and
creative synthesis of systems.

## Success Criteria:
* A playable game with functional mechanics and meaningful choices.
* A compelling narrative that motivates progression.
* Coherent worldbuilding and lore.

You are not expected to follow a fixed template. This task is a test of your creativity, strategic planning,
self-directed iteration.
